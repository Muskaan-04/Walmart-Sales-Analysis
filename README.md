This project presents a comprehensive end-to-end sales analysis of Walmart’s retail data using **Python**, **Power BI**, and a structured **CSV** dataset. It replicates a real-world business intelligence solution — from raw data preprocessing to dashboard visualization.

## Tools & Files

- **Python (`Walmart.ipynb`)**  
  Used to clean and preprocess the raw sales data from `Walmart.csv`. Key steps include handling null values, creating time-based features (month, year), and exporting a refined dataset.

- **Raw Data (`Walmart.csv`)**  
  Contains transactional-level sales information from Walmart.

- **Power BI Template (`Walmart.pbit`)**  
  A reusable dashboard template designed to highlight key performance metrics, product trends, and regional performance. The `.pbit` format allows others to plug in new datasets with the same structure.

- **PDF Report (`Walmart.Dashboard.pdf`)**  
  A static snapshot of the interactive dashboard, suitable for presentations or stakeholder reports.

- **README.md**  
  Full documentation, insight summary, and usage instructions.
